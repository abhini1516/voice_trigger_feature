# **🔊 VoiceTrigger: Core**

A simple, offline Python engine that listens for spoken keywords ("help", "sos") and triggers an alert in the terminal. It's a perfect starting point for adding voice commands to any project.

## **⚡ Get Started in 2 Minutes**

1.  **Clone and setup:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice_trigger_feature.git
    cd voice_trigger_feature
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run it:**
    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```
    Talk into your microphone and say "**help**" or "**sos**". You'll see an alert in your terminal.

## **🧩 How to Extend It (Add Your Own Actions)**

The code is built for easy modification. **You just change one part.**

1.  Open the `test.py` file in a code editor.

2.  Find this section:
    ```python
    if "help" in keyword or "sos" in keyword:
        print(f"🚨 ALERT TRIGGERED: '{keyword}' detected!") # <-- REPLACE THIS
    ```

3.  **Replace the `print` statement** with your own code. For example:

    **Make a loud beep:**
    ```python
    import os
    os.system("echo '\a'") # Makes a system beep
    ```

    **Send an HTTP request (for smart home/APIs):**
    ```python
    import requests
    requests.get("http://localhost:5000/trigger-alarm")
    ```

    **Log the event to a file:**
    ```python
    with open("alerts.log", "a") as f:
        f.write("Help was called!\n")
    ```

That's it! The next time you run the script, your custom action will execute instead of just printing to the terminal.
